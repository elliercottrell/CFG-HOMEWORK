Complete definitions for key Git & GitHub terminology
GIT WORKFLOW FUNDAMENTALS
·        Working Directory - The space where you work on your files. Sort of like a project
         folder which holds all the files.
·        Staging Area - inside repository - a bit like a rough draft which you worked on in
         the working directory, saved into the staging area, when all the files are ready they
         can be saved in the next version of your project.
·        Local Repo (head) The latest or most current branch of the repo you are working on
         locally on your computer.
·        Remote repo (master) hosted repositories - such as GitHub, where your repo is stored
         online the master is the main branch.

WORKING DIRECTORY STATES:
·        Staged - draft files that are ready to be committed.
·        Modified - changed files which may or may not have already been committed.
·        Committed - files which have been updated/changed in the repository.

GIT COMMANDS:
·        Git add - updates the index with the current content of specified files - you want to
         have the index of files up to date before committing.
·        Git commit - creates a new commit wth the current contents of index.
·        Git push - updates the remote repo with the local repo.
·        Git fetch - fetches branches created in the remote repo, or from other repos to work on locally.
·        Git merge - adds changes from the commits into the current branch.
·        Git pull - incorporates changes from remote repositories into current branch - it runs git
         fetch and then git merge (or rebase).
